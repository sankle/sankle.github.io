I am a first year PhD student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu), working in [AquaLab](https://aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu), advised by [Prof. Fabi√°n E. Bustamante](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~fabianb). My research focuses on networks and distributed systems, specifically on Internet infrastructure such as the Submarine Cable Network (SCN).
