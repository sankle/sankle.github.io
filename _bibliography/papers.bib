    abstract = "The Venezuelan crisis, unfolding over the past decade, has garnered international attention due to its impact on various sectors of civil society. While studies have extensively covered the crisis's effects on public health, energy, and water management, this paper delves into a previously unexplored area - the impact on Venezuela’s Internet infrastructure. Amidst Venezuela’s multifaceted challenges, understanding the repercussions of this critical aspect of modern society becomes imperative for the country's recovery.
    Leveraging measurements from various sources, we present a comprehensive view of the changes undergone by the Venezuelan network in the past decade. Our study reveals the significant impact of the crisis captured by different signals, including bandwidth stagnation, limited growth on network infrastructure growth, and high latency compared to the Latin American average. Beyond offering a new perspective on the Venezuelan crisis, our study can help inform attempts at devising strategies for its recovery.",
